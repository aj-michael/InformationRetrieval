An implementation of the Okapi BM25 scoring function as described here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25

To prepare the model, run the following command
python preprocess.py

To run a query, run the following command
python score.py query k1 b

where query is the query string and k1 and b are free numeric parameters. k1 is typically chosen from the interval [1.2,2.0] and b is typically 0.75.
