An implementation of the Skip Ngram scoring technique as described in Murdock, Fan, Lally, Shima and Boguraev's 'Textual Evidence Gathering and Analysis'.

To run a query, use the command:
    python skipbigrams.py <query> <skip count>
where <query> is the string you are scoring and <skip count> is the maximum allowed skips between words in the considered ngrams.
